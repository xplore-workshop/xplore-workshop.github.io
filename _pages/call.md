## Submission Details

To encourage participation and foster high-quality discussions from a broad community, we plan to:

- Announce open calls for submissions on this website **at least 2 months before** the submission deadline.
- Notify authors **at least 1.5 months before** the workshop to facilitate travel plans.
- Present accepted submissions on the website prior to the conference and as **spotlight talks** during the workshop.
- Target **~10 accepted submissions**, with each spotlight **~6 minutes** (no Q&A).
- Host a **poster session** and a **junior panel** for deeper interaction.
- Invite a subset of authors to the **junior panel** to discuss challenges, emerging topics, and blue-sky ideas.

### Tracks & Format
We plan to accept **two kinds of submissions**:
1. **Traditional submissions** presenting preliminary results of ongoing research (long papers), including negative results and open problems (**extended abstracts**).
2. **Submissions linked to already published papers**, including:
   - Journal papers that have not been discussed at a conference.
   - Conference papers from other Robotics and Machine Learning/AI venues where a focused community discussion would add value.

These two categories will be **managed separately**, so there is **no competition** between already peer-reviewed work and preliminary results.

**Length & Style:**
- **Paper (long):** up to **6 pages** (excluding references).  
- **Extended abstract:** up to **2 pages** (excluding references).  
- Use the **IEEE conference style** (no template link provided).

**Review:**
- **Single-blind** review process.

**Multimedia:**
- Authors are encouraged to include **videos** illustrating their work.

**Selection preference:**
- Works at the **intersection** of multiple workshop topics are favored.
